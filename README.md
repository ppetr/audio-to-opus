# Reduce the size of audio files by converting them to the [Opus audio format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_(audio_format))

_*Disclaimer:* This is not an officially supported Google product._

This is expecially convenient for audio-books that are often encoded with
unnecessarily high bandwidth.

Opus is very well suited for low-bandwidth speech encoding.

The script performs encoding using `ffmpeg`, or
[`ffmpeg-normalize`](https://github.com/slhck/ffmpeg-normalize) if present.
